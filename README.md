# Project Summary

### Project Context

Airbnb, a titan in the "sharing economy" industry whose primary goal is provide an online platform for property owners to rent out their houses to guest on a short term basis. From homestays to vacation rentals, airbnb listings have been our generation's goto place to search for t ideal vacation lodging in whichever country we happen to visit. However majority of the time, guest do not just search for accomodations that are cheap, but ones that have amenities of their desire and are also close to tourist hot spots in Singapore.

### Organisational Goals

The website aims to allow users to locate Airbnb listings on a map to and provides a search function to locate and plot the fastest route to places of interest in Singapore relative from their desired lodging, using data obtained from InsideAirbnb Data, OneMapAPI and the FoursquareAPI. The website also needs to be responsive and work on multiple mobile platforms ranging from small phones to large screen desktops.

### User Goals

Users will be able to pick and select their desired Airbnb listings and view information regarding their selection, from lodging images, size of the property, to amenities that the listing will provide. Past reviews provided by previous guest can also be viewed, and users can explore nearby places and plan their route by utilising the search/route plotting function, allowing them to make informed decisions on whether to commit to renting the property.

### Justification for the App

While the listing information is also readily available on the Airbnb website, only a small handful of listings are always shown (approx 10 listings per page). Alot of time is thus spent on scrolling through all the website searching for their ideal lodging. At the same time, other factors such as proximity of the lodge to tourist sites require the usage of other apps such as Google maps. Thus by combining this two features (with potentially more in the future), an interactive map would make it easier for users to select their ideal lodging close to places they might visit during their vacation, while not having to constantly change apps.
